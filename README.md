This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained Detectron2 model for object detection on custom images. 
The model was previously trained and saved as model_final.pth. 
The notebook allows you to upload your own images, run inference on them, and visualize the detection results.

Features 
Load a custom trained model.

Upload and process user-provided images.

Perform object detection with Detectron2.

Visualize detection results with bounding boxes and labels.

Display all processed images in a grid layout.


Tools and Libraries Python

PyTorch

Detectron2

OpenCV

Matplotlib


How to Run I
nstall necessary libraries (torch, detectron2, opencv-python, matplotlib).

Load the model_final.pth file.

Upload your images.

Run the inference and display results.

Notes GPU acceleration is recommended for faster inference.

Make sure the uploaded images are in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png format.
